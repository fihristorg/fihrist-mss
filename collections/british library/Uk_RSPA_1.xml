                <title key="work_21873">al-Farāʾiḍ al-sharīfiyyah fī sharḥ al-sirājiyyah</title> by <persName key="viaf_19930855" role="aut">al-Sharīf al-Jurjānī</persName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>This manuscript includes the lengthy translator's preface in which it is stated that he completed his translation from the Arabic original on 10th Dhū 'l-Ḥijjah 1189 AH, which corresponds to February 1st 1776 AD. The translator writes that the translation was undertaken thanks to the generosity and culture of 
                <persName key="viaf_29571391" role="pat">Warren Hastings</persName> (Governor-General of Bengal, 1774-85) who employed him to do the task. Bardavānī refers to him using his Persian honorific, ʿImād al-Dīn Bahādur Jalādat-Jang, rather than his English name. Jones, who received this manuscript copy as a gift from Hastings, wrote his name in English above it on f5v.
                        </p>
                        <p>On every page which is not taken up with the textblock, Jones has made considerable notes and annotations. These include a series of Sanskrit paragraphs (one of which he says is from the Veda) (ff.a-c), a series of family trees which represent specific cases found inside the work (ff. f-h), a Biblical conversation between Moses and God (f.j), a title page (f.l) on which he has also written some points of Persian grammar and that this manuscript was a gift from Warren Hastings to Sir William Jones. On f1r, there is then a list of female and male names which are presumably mentioned in the text. After the Moses quotation, he signs his name in Arabic and Sanskrit.</p>
                        <p>After the textblock, Jones has written out more mathematical equations of cases from the text. He has also written out a section of Piero Soderini's (d.1552) speech to the senate of Florence in Italian about governance and liberty.</p>

                     <p>Jones has heavily annotated this addition with marginal notes on nearly every page. These mostly consist of highlighting (with curly brackets or star symbols), translating words (into both English and Latin) or writing out the metre of a poem. He also makes copious numerical notations, expressing the sums in the text in mathematical form.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the main textblock, Jones has written "read four times with great attention, 22nd February 1793". He had peviously commented that he had read the text three times, but this is crossed out.</p>
