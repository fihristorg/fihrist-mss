                     <note>
                        <p>A copy of the Iskandar-nāmah which does not separate the text into two parts. The text of Iskandar-nāmah is also very different from the standard (modern printed) edition; the differences from the Sprenger edition (completed by 1869) are indicated throughout the text of the Iskandar-nāmah in pencil marginal annotations by a modern hand.</p>
                        <p>Jones notes on f1r, "I bought this fine copy of Niẓāmī for 100 S.R. the seller having at first demanded 200. 11 April, 1788 W Jones" and, in Persian, "مالک این کتاب یر ولیام یونس یکی از حاکمان عدالت عالیه پادشاهی در شهر کلکته قیمتش صد روپیه" Above these notes, there are two large notes which state this book had been the property of Mīr Muḥammad Bāqir.</p>
                        <p>Jones makes extensive annotations and marginal comments on the Haft Paykar exclusively. This text he annotates for linguistic reasons (in both Persian and English) and he writes notes about the story and the miniatures. As for the other texts, he also writes out their title and the metre of the poem on each of their first pages. On f144r, the second page of Majnūn Laylī, he notes in Persian: "من بیدل وراه بیماکست چون را هبرم توئی چباکست". Jones also makes two important notes outside of the textblock; on fiv verso, he notes the seven parts of the story of Haft Paykar and on f411v, he notes in a circular shape the names (right to left, top to bottom): Firdawsī, Mavlavī, Saʿadī, Anvarī, Ḥāfiẓ and Niẓāmī. His annotations and comments on Haft Paykar are too numerous to list and warrant some extensive study.</p>
